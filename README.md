# Hi, Thank You For Checking Out :Project #2 - Simon Says Game Project  

<br />
<br />

## About This Project:

- What the application does: This is a simplistic version of the "Simon Says Game". You start of the game by pressing any key on the keyboard. The user then proceeds to play the same set of colours that were displayed. If they are correct with the set of colours that they pressed then the game will continue. However, one single mistake and the game will restart!
- Motivation Behind Creation: I created this project with the end-goal in mind of understanding more about DOM Manipulation, even moreso with the use of the jQuery library.
- Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)
- Challenges Faced: This project was the most to date (31/03/2022). Although I had a solid understanding of DOM manipulation in vanilla JavaScript e.g. document.querySelector("#level-title").addClass("pressed"); would be $("#level-title").addClass("pressed") in jQuery. However, understanding how each component worked with each other was difficult. Although, I managed to breakdown every single step of the game itself into smaller chunks starting with keeping track of the user clicks through eventListeners and pushing them into arrays, and checking for the user input to the game's randomly generated pattern.
